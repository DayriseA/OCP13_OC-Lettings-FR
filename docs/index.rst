Welcome to OC Lettings's documentation!
=======================================

This project, including this documentation, is part of a school project.
The goal is to start with an existing project in poor condition and improve it:

* Overhaul the modular structure (splitting into apps, etc.)
* Reduce various technical debts on the project (linting, testing, error handling, etc.)
* Configure logging, install and configure Sentry to track errors
* Add CI/CD
* Make this documentation and host it on ReadTheDocs
